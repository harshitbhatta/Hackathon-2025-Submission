# HackWestTX-2024
This was our submission for Texas Tech's HackwestTX 2024 hackathon in September. We took Patterson UTI's company challenge to gamify their frac data to promote healthy competition. ReactJS, HTML, and CSS BootStrap were used for the frontend, django and python for backend. Plotly JS was used for visualization of data.
